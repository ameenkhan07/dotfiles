# Dotfiles Source

My dotfiles, based on **the** [Holman Dotfiles Ideology](http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/), uses *Holman's* dots as a starting point, *oh-my-zsh* for the sexy themes/plugins and [*duffer's*](https://github.com/dufferzafar/dotfiles) heedfully curated tidbits from all the other dotfiles. 
Special mention to [*Mathias's* dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles).

### Navigating the topical structure

Everything's built around topic areas. If you're adding a new area to your
forked dotfiles — say, "Java" — you can simply add a `java` directory and put
files in there. Anything with an extension of `.zsh` will get automatically
included into your shell. Anything with an extension of `.symlink` will get
symlinked without extension into `$HOME` when you run `script/bootstrap`.

## Holman Components

There's a few special files in the hierarchy.

- **bin/**: Anything in `bin/` will get added to your `$PATH` and be made
  available everywhere.
- **topic/\*.zsh**: Any files ending in `.zsh` get loaded into your
  environment.
- **topic/path.zsh**: Any file named `path.zsh` is loaded first and is
  expected to setup `$PATH` or similar.
- **topic/completion.zsh**: Any file named `completion.zsh` is loaded
  last and is expected to setup autocomplete.
- **topic/\*.symlink**: Any files ending in `*.symlink` get symlinked into
  your `$HOME`. This is so you can keep all of those versioned in your dotfiles
  but still keep those autoloaded files in your home directory. These get
  symlinked in when you run `script/bootstrap`.
- **Brewfile**: One file to rule them all. Installs all dev/UI tools to be required, all packaged neatly in a file.

## Installing the dotfiles repo

To Setup macos:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ameenkhan07/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
sh ./script/bootstrap
```

This will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory.
Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`.

`dot` is a simple script that installs some dependencies, sets sane macOS
defaults, and so on. Tweak this script, and occasionally run `dot` from
time to time to keep your environment fresh and up-to-date. You can find
this script in `bin/`.

```

## TODO

- Iterm2 profile `symlinks`
- VSCode profile `symlinks`
- Configure Powerlevel9k
- `vimrc` : GOD Mode Level.
